ideas:

- one different color eye when clicked on that it will open the modal explaining what is this, and why is this created(main philosophy)
- when moving in the phone, and moving the gyro, it will also move the pupil with the phone movement, in the desktop it's going to be mouse movement
- accidentally clicking on any eyes, will make he chaos, closing and opening the eye, like the real one, and moving the pupil of the eyes in random order
- there should be a dance mode, where music plays in the background and eyes dance with the great rhythm and sequence
- camera tracking also(this would be really dope)

this thing needs to be responsive
